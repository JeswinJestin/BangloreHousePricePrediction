# Bengaluru House Price Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bengaluru, India, using a dataset containing various property features. The project follows a typical data science pipeline, including data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, outlier handling, and visualization, to prepare the data for model training.

Project Steps:
Data Loading and Initial Exploration:

Load the house price dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Perform initial checks to understand the dataset's structure, dimensions, and data types.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values by dropping rows with null entries (justified by the large dataset size).
Address inconsistencies in the 'size' column by extracting the numerical BHK count.
Standardize the 'total_sqft' column by converting range values to their average and identifying non-standard entries.
Feature Engineering:

Create a new feature, 'price_per_sqft', which is a key metric in real estate analysis and aids in outlier identification.
Dimensionality Reduction:

Reduce the number of unique location categories by grouping locations with a low number of occurrences into an 'other' category to manage the high cardinality of the 'location' feature.
Outlier Detection and Removal:

Identify and remove outliers based on domain knowledge (e.g., minimum square feet per BHK) and statistical methods (e.g., using standard deviation of 'price_per_sqft' per location).
Data Visualization:

Visualize the data using plots like scatter charts to explore relationships between features (e.g., total square feet, price, BHK) and identify patterns or potential outliers.
Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the "Bengaluru House Data.csv", which contains information about properties in Bengaluru, including:

area_type: Type of area (e.g., Super built-up Area, Built-up Area)
availability: Availability status
location: Location of the property
size: Size of the property in BHK or Bedrooms
society: Society name
total_sqft: Total square footage of the property
bath: Number of bathrooms
balcony: Number of balconies
price: Price of the property (in Lakhs)
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Getting Started:
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib).
Run the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) to follow the data processing and analysis steps.
Future Work:
Implement various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Lasso, Decision Tree) for price prediction.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the chosen model.
Potentially explore additional feature engineering techniques.
